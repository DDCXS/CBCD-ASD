A Consortium Blockchain-based Cross-Domain Authentication Scheme for Drones（CBCD-ASD）

The CBCD-ASD program is divided into five phases:
1. Initialization phase
2. Drone-joining phase
3. Cross-domain authentication and key agreement phase
4. Drone certificate information update phase
5. Drone certificate revocation phase

The solution uses the formal security analysis tool Proverif to prove the security of the drone joining phase, and the cross-domain authentication phase.
